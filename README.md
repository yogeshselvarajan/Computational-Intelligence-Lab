# Computational Intelligence Laboratory Repository

Welcome to the Computational Intelligence Laboratory repository for the 7th semester of the Undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering program at Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi.

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various exercises related to Computational Intelligence.

## Exercise 1: Uninformed Search Algorithms (UCS, DFS, BFS)

The first exercise focuses on implementing uninformed search algorithms such as Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The goal is to provide a menu-driven program that allows dynamic modification of the graph, printing the graph as an adjacency list, and performing search algorithms between given start and end nodes.

### Getting Started

To get started with the exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/yogeshselvarajan/Computational-Intelligence-Lab/
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder
3. Compile and run the program by the local README file command at the local folder.

### Additional Exercises
This repository also has additional exercises that are not part of the lab curriculum. These exercises are:
   - Maze Solver using DFS and BFS algorithms 
   - Network Routing using UCS algorithm
