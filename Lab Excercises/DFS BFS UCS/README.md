# Exercise 1: Uninformed Search (BFS, DFS, UCS)

- This exercise focuses on implementing uninformed search algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS). 
- The main task is to represent the graph as an adjacency list and allow dynamic modification of the graph at runtime. 
- Here the required data structures such as Queue, Stack, and Priority Queue are implemented from scratch. 
- The program is written in Python 3.11.4

### Functionality

1. Initialize a base graph as input.
2. Allow the user to add edges and nodes dynamically to modify the base graph.
3. Allow the user to delete edges and nodes dynamically.
4. Print the entire graph as an adjacency list.
5. Print the adjacency list of a particular node.
6. Perform BFS, DFS, and UCS with a given start and end node.
7. Provide a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

### Menu Options

The following menu options are available:

1. **Add Node**: Add a new node to the graph.
2. **Add Edge**: Add a new edge between two nodes.
3. **Delete Node**: Remove a node from the graph.
4. **Delete Edge**: Remove an edge between two nodes.
5. **Print Graph**: Print the entire graph as an adjacency list.
6. **Print Node**: Print the adjacency list of a specific node.
7. **BFS**: Perform Breadth-First Search on the graph.
8. **DFS**: Perform Depth-First Search on the graph.
9. **UCS**: Perform Uniform Cost Search on the graph.
10. **Exit**: Quit the program.

### Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/yogeshselvarajan/Computational-Intelligence-Lab.git`
2. Change directory to the repository: `cd Lab Excercises/DFS BFS UCS`
3. Compile and run the program: `python3 UninformedSearch.py`
