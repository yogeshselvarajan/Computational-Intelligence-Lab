# Exercise 2: Informed Search (A*)

This exercise focuses on implementing the Informed Search algorithm A* in Python. A* is a widely used graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm, capable of finding the shortest path in a graph with heuristics.

The program is written in Python 3.11.4.

## Functionality

- Initialize a base directed graph as input.
- Allow users to add edges and nodes dynamically to modify the base graph.
- Print the entire graph structure showing the relationship between nodes and their respective heuristics.
- Perform A* search to find the optimal path from a start node to an end node.
- Traverse the graph and display all possible paths from the start to end nodes with their respective costs.
- Provide a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## Menu Options

The following menu options are available:

1. Create Test Graph: Initialize a predefined test graph.
2. Input a Directed Graph: Manually input a directed graph.
3. Add New Node: Add a new node to the graph.
4. Add New Edge: Add a new edge between two nodes.
5. Print Directed Graph Info: Display the entire directed graph structure.
6. Get Neighbors of a Node: Display the neighbors of a specific node in the graph.
7. A* Algorithm: Find the optimal path using the A* algorithm.
8. Exit: Quit the program.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yogeshselvarajan/Computational-Intelligence-Lab.git`
2. Change directory to the appropriate exercise folder: `cd Lab Excercises/A Star Search/`
3. Run the Python program: `python3 InformedSearch.py`
