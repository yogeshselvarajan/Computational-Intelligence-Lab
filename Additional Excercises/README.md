# Additional Exercise - Maze Solver and Network Routing

This folder contains additional exercises for the lab. The exercises are not mandatory and are not graded. They are intended to help you practice the concepts learned in the lab. 

## 1. Maze Solver

The Maze Solver is implemented using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to find a solution path in a maze. It includes the following features:

- BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path in the maze.
- DFS algorithm for exploring all possible paths in the maze.
- Visualization using turtle graphics to display the maze solving process.

## 2. Network Routing

The Network Routing exercise implements the UCS (Uniform Cost Search) algorithm for finding the minimum latency delivery path in a network routing application. It includes the following features:

- Graph representation of the network environment.
- Adding connection points and latencies to the graph.
- Printing the network topology.
- Finding reachable nodes from a given connection point.
- Performing UCS to find the minimum latency path.
